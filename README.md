# Particles Playground

A WebGL project driven by particles, built with Three.js and GSAP. The particles are constructed using custom shaders and utilize image textures as the base for coloring and rendering their appearance.

Custom shaders handle particle behavior, transforming images into interactive displays. It supports dynamic effects like texture transitions, mouse and touch interactions, and a flowing "tail" effect for interaction with particles. Performance is optimized with FPS limiting and throttled events.

This project utilizes GLSL 2D simplex noise within the shaders, originally developed by [Ian McEwan](https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/blob/master/src/noise2D.glsl). Part of the vertex shader is also inspired by examples from Shadertoy, but since this is an updated version of my years-old project, the original reference has been lost.

# Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
- [gsap](https://github.com/gsap/gsap)
  <br />

# Installation

```
npm install

//run example
npx vite
npx vite --host        //expose 'host' for external/mobile device
npx vite build
npx vite preview
```

<br />

# How to use

Grab effect.js or the minified version and set it up according to the example in index.html.

```javascript
// Array of scene configurations where each object represents a separate scene
// with its own texture(url), text, and particle behavior settings
const texturesOptions = [
  {
    index: 0,
    url: "/img/1.jpg",
    quote:
      "Creating particles so <span class='colorful'>colorful</span>, they might just distract you from reading this text.",
    threshold: 20,
    random: 4.0,
    depth: 1.0,
    size: 1.7,
    square: 0,
  },

  {
    index: 1,
    url: "/img/2.jpg",
    quote:
      "Hello, curious human, or are you just  <span style='color:#f4852a'>here</span> for the particles?",
    threshold: 60,
    random: 1.0,
    depth: 1.0,
    size: 0.5,
    square: 1,
  },
  ...
];
let effect = new Effect(texturesOptions);
effect.init();
```
